## Current best (BEAT THIS)

| Config | GPU(s) | Decode tok/s | Prefill tok/s | Coherent | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------------:|---------------:|----------|-------|
| ⭐⭐⭐ vLLM lab v0.21.1 PIECEWISE, AutoRound INT4, MTP5, fp16 | 1× B70 | **90.1** hard | — | ✅ | TARGET EXCEEDED. 95.2% acceptance, mean acc len 5.76. intel/llm-scaler-vllm:0.21.0-b3 + ctypes ptr fix + --dtype float16. |

### Known ceilings (lab results)
| Config | Decode tok/s | Notes |
|--------|-------------:|-------|
| llama.cpp Q4_K_M TP2 (AOT build) | 49.72 | Lab best with AOT bmg_g31 |

## Benchmark protocol (use EXACTLY this every iteration)

1. Apply config change (edit `docker-compose.yml` env or `entrypoint.sh` flags).
2. Sync to host: `scp docker-compose.yml entrypoint.sh omarchy:/home/sero/qwen38-b70/`
3. Restart: `ssh omarchy 'cd /home/sero/qwen38-b70 && docker compose up -d --force-recreate'`
4. Wait for health: poll `curl -s http://omarchy:8010/health` until `{"status":"ok"}` (up to 180s).
5. **Throughput** — single-stream decode, 2.5k context:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://omarchy:8010/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"qwen3.8-27b","max_tokens":256,"temperature":0,
          "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"<2.5k-token prompt>"}]}' \
     | jq '{tok_out:.usage.completion_tokens, t:.timings.predicted_per_token_ms}'
   ```
   Use the fixed 2.5k prompt in `bench_prompt.txt` (create it once, reuse). Decode tok/s ≈
   `completion_tokens / timings.predicted_s`. Server `/metrics` also exposes
   `prompt_eval_rate` and `predict_rate` — use those.
6. **Coherence gate** — generate a short factual answer and eyeball it:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://omarchy:8010/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"qwen3.8-27b","max_tokens":64,"temperature":0,
          "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is 17 times 3? Answer with just the number."}]}'
   ```
   Expected: "51". If output is garbage, `!!!`, repeated chars, or wrong → **FAIL, revert**.
   Also ask: "Name the capital of France." → expect "Paris".
7. Record result in **History** below. If faster AND coherent → update **Current best**.
   If slower or incoherent → revert the change (`git checkout docker-compose.yml entrypoint.sh`).

## Search space (knobs to climb)

Ordered by expected leverage. Work top-down. Mark each as DONE/FAIL/SKIP in History
before moving on.

### Tier 1 — cheap runtime toggles (container restart only, no rebuild)
- [x] KV cache: `--cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v q8_0` (smaller KV → faster attn, may lose quality) — **FAIL 27.0 tok/s, 40% slower** (dequant overhead > bandwidth; only 16/64 layers use KV)
- [ ] KV cache: `--cache-type-k q5_1 --cache-type-v q5_1`
- [ ] KV cache: `--cache-type-k q4_0 --cache-type-v q4_0` (aggressive; likely quality loss)
- [ ] MTP draft-max: try 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 (current 8). Measure decode tok/s AND acceptance.
- [ ] MTP + KV q8_0 combo
- [x] THREADS: 4, 6, 12, 16 (current 8) — **4=40.5 FAIL**. 6/12/16 still untested.
- [ ] `--poll` : 0, 10, 100, 200 (current 50)
- [ ] `GGML_SYCL_FATTN_MMA=1` (joint_matrix; documented unavailable under JIT but try)
- [ ] `GGML_SYCL_FUSE_EXT` bitmask: try 0, 15, 63, 127 (current 31)
- [ ] `flash-attn off` vs on (sanity; expect slower)
- [ ] BATCH/UBATCH: 4096, 16384, 32768 (current 8192; affects prefill mostly)
- [ ] `--cont-batching` / PARALLEL=2,4 with 2-4 concurrent requests → measure AGGREGATE tok/s

### Tier 2 — model swap (requires download from ggml-org/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF)
- [ ] Q4_0 (smaller, faster dequant, may lose quality)
- [ ] Q5_K_M (larger, slower but higher quality — only if Q4 paths plateau)
- [ ] Q8_0 (sanity ceiling; will be slower but confirms coherence upper bound)

### Tier 3 — structural (only if Tier 1+2 plateau)
- [ ] AOT `bmg_g31` build under oneAPI 2026.1.x (needs working UR driver; likely blocked)
- [ ] Q4K reorder-family kernels (need AOT layout; blocked on JIT build)
- [ ] Custom SYCL kernel patches

## History (append-only; most recent at top)

| Iter | Date/Time | Change | Decode tok/s | Coherent? | Verdict |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------:|-----------|---------|
| 0 | 2026-08-18 baseline | Q4_K_M KV f16 TP2 | 45.4 | ✅ | BASELINE (measured with bench.sh, 3.7k prompt) |
| 0b | 2026-08-18 baseline | + MTP draft-max 8 (easy) | 84.3 | ✅ | MTP BASELINE (from README, not re-measured) |
| 1 | 2026-08-18 01:00 | KV q8_0 (k+v) | 27.0 | ✅ | FAIL — 40% slower. Dequant overhead > bandwidth savings (only 16/64 layers use KV; GDN is O(1) state). Reverted. |
| 2 | 2026-08-18 01:10 | MTP draft-mtp n-max 8 | 36.7 | ✅ | FAIL hard — 19% slower than baseline. bench.sh prompt is hard-task (random gen), MTP acceptance ~37%, draft overhead > benefit. Note: README's 84.3 was on easy counting task. |
| 3 | 2026-08-18 01:15 | MTP draft-mtp n-max 1 | 34.8 hard / 53.8 easy | ✅ | SPLIT — hard task 23% slower, easy task 18% faster than baseline 45.4. MTP helps easy tasks, hurts hard tasks. Need baseline easy-task number for fair comparison. |
| 3b | 2026-08-18 01:20 | Baseline (no MTP) 5 warm runs | 43.7 hard / 45.5 easy | ✅ | ESTABLISHED BASELINE (warm). MTP n-max 1: hard -20%, easy +18%. MTP is net loss for general/coherence-critical workloads. MTP OFF is the default. |
| 4 | 2026-08-18 01:30 | THREADS=4 | 40.5 hard / 44.2 easy | ✅ | FAIL — 9% slower hard, 4% slower easy. Fewer threads hurts CPU-side dispatch. Reverted to THREADS=8. |
| 5 | 2026-08-18 02:00 | ⭐ Q4K SwiGLU fusion ON (MMQ_Q4K_REORDER=1, FUSED_MMVQ_SWIGLU_Q4K=1) | 46.7 hard / 46.4 easy | ✅ | NEW BEST (llama.cpp) — +5.4% decode. Fuses FFN gate+up+SwiGLU into 1 kernel. Coherent (51, Paris). Lab gets 49.72 with AOT build. KEPT. |
| 6 | 2026-08-19 12:30 | vLLM/XPU AWQ-INT4 1× B70 eager | 11.0 | ✅ | vLLM path opened. AWQ-INT4 (compressed-tensors) loads with XPUwNa16LinearKernel. Eager mode too slow — no graph capture. Coherent. |
| 7 | 2026-08-19 13:00 | vLLM/XPU AWQ-INT4 1× B70 + XPU Graph | 27.0 | ✅ | XPU Graph (VLLM_XPU_ENABLE_XPU_GRAPH=1) gives 2.5× over eager. GDN decode falls back to Triton (fused CUDA kernel requires compute_capability 80, XPU doesn't have it). Coherent. |
| 8 | 2026-08-19 14:05 | vLLM/XPU AutoRound-INT4 1× B70 + XPU Graph | 27.8 | ✅ | AutoRound model (17.7 GB, ALL layers quantized including GDN) vs AWQ (19.1 GB, GDN unquantized). Same speed — bottleneck is Triton GDN decode kernel, not weight bandwidth. Coherent. |
| 9 | 2026-08-19 14:15 | vLLM/XPU AutoRound-INT4 + MTP5 (eager) | CRASH | — | FAIL — `ValueError: Overflow when unpacking long long` in mamba_utils.py:767. XPU device pointers (0xFFFF... range) overflow int64 storage. Patched with `& ((1<<63)-1)` mask — no crash but output is garbage (masked pointers cause wrong memory reads). Needs upstream fix: use uint64 for state_base_addrs. |
| 10 | 2026-08-19 14:30 | vLLM/XPU AutoRound-INT4 TP2 (eager) | CRASH | — | FAIL — `UR_RESULT_ERROR_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` in auto_round_kernel woqgemm on TP rank 1. Same TP2 instability as llama.cpp. |
| 11 | 2026-08-19 14:45 | vLLM/XPU AWQ-INT4 TP2 (eager, CCL socket-IPC fix) | CRASH | — | FAIL — `UR_RESULT_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` during profiling warmup. oneCCL socket-IPC fix (CCL_ZE_IPC_EXCHANGE=sockets) allows distributed init to pass, but GPU is lost during KV cache profiling. TP2 on vLLM/XPU is not stable. |
| 12 | 2026-08-19 17:40 | vLLM MTP5 + XPU Graph (ptr overflow fixed via ctypes.c_int64) | CRASH→GARBAGE | — | ⚠️ Fixed pointer overflow properly (ctypes.c_int64 preserves bit pattern, verified with Triton ptr arithmetic test). MTP loads, server starts, but output is garbage. Root cause: XPU Graph bakes attn_metadata into captured graph; MTP changes metadata every step → stale reads. |
| 13 | 2026-08-19 18:10 | vLLM MTP5 + eager (no XPU Graph) | 4.0 hard / 4.1 easy | ✅ | Coherent but too slow — kernel launch overhead dominates without graph. MTP acceptance 84% (mean len 5.2). The MTP draft model works correctly; only graph capture is broken. |
| 14 | 2026-08-19 18:30 | vLLM MTP5 + torch.compile (no graph, no breakable) | 4.0 hard / 4.1 easy | ✅ | Same speed as eager — torch.compile without graph capture doesn't eliminate launch overhead. MTP acceptance 84% (mean len 5.2). |
| 15 | 2026-08-19 19:10 | vLLM MTP5 + breakable cudagraph + patched CompilationMode | CRASH | — | FAIL — `RuntimeError: wait cannot be called for a queue which is recording to a command graph`. Breakable CG tries torch.xpu.synchronize() inside graph capture, which XPU doesn't allow. XPU Graph + breakable CG is incompatible. |
| 16 | 2026-08-19 19:40 | llama.cpp MTP n-max=8 2× B70 (CPU draft) | 56.9 hard / 97.1 easy | ✅ | ⭐ MTP on llama.cpp works correctly! Acceptance: hard 52.5%, easy 91%. Mean draft len 5.2-8.2. Draft model on CPU (TP2 occupies both GPUs, can't offload draft). |

| 20 | 2026-08-19 20:20 | llama.cpp MTP n-max=5 1× B70 draft on GPU | 43.0 hard / 56.1 easy | ✅ | 1× B70: draft model offloads to GPU (no TP2 split). Acceptance: hard 69%, easy 95%. Base ~30 tok/s × 1.4× MTP speedup = 43. |
| 21 | 2026-08-19 20:30 | llama.cpp MTP n-max=4 1× B70 draft on GPU | 38.1 hard / 50.7 easy | ✅ | n-max=4 worse than 5 on 1× B70. Lower n-max reduces total draft tokens generated. |

MTP works on XPU! First coherent vLLM+MTP output. Acceptance 75%, mean acc len 4.2. (Earlier number — later re-tested at 90.1 with same config, initial run may have been cold cache.) |
| 23 | 2026-08-19 23:36 | vLLM lab PIECEWISE MTP1 fp16 1× B70 | 52.6 hard | ✅ | MTP1 = 99.2% acceptance, mean acc len 1.99. Lower spec tokens = higher acceptance but less speedup. |
| 24 | 2026-08-19 23:46 | vLLM lab PIECEWISE MTP2 fp16 1× B70 | 67.8 hard | ✅ | MTP2 = 98.9% acceptance, mean acc len 2.98. Already exceeds 60 tok/s 1× target! |

| 28 | 2026-08-20 00:21 | vLLM lab PIECEWISE MTP5 dual instances 2× B70 | 179.8 aggregate | ✅ | REVERTED — user rejected dual independent instances approach. 2× target must use real TP2 or prefill/decode disaggregation, not independent instances. |
| 29 | 2026-08-20 17:23 | vLLM TP2 eager (GDN ESIMD patch + skip-mm-profiling) | 16.2 hard | ✅ | First working TP2! GDN ESIMD eligibility patched (try/except for quantized RowParallelLinear). skip-mm-profiling bypasses vision encoder all_reduce crash. XCCL all_reduce works for decode (small tensors). Coherent (51, Paris). |
| 30 | 2026-08-20 17:46 | vLLM TP2 eager OOM on long prompts | CRASH | — | FAIL — block_table copy_to_gpu OOM (UR_RESULT_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY) with 0.85 util. Reduced to 0.45 util. non_blocking=False patch didn't help. |
| 31 | 2026-08-20 18:01 | vLLM TP2 PIECEWISE + MTP5 | TIMEOUT | — | FAIL — TP1 never finishes inductor compilation. TP0 compiles in ~90s, TP1 hangs at "Failed to read file <frozen os>". SHM broadcast times out. VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=900 didn't help — TP1 is deadlocked, not timing out. |
| 32 | 2026-08-20 18:30 | vLLM TP2 gloo backend | CRASH | — | FAIL — gloo can't all_reduce XPU tensors: "No backend type associated with device type xpu". Gloo only supports CPU tensors. |
| 33 | 2026-08-20 18:38 | vLLM TP2 eager + MTP5 + CPU gloo all_reduce fallback | 37.4 hard / 52.0 easy | ✅ | XCCL all_reduce fails with OUT_OF_RESOURCES during profile_run. Patched xpu_communicator.py to catch RuntimeError and fall back to CPU gloo all_reduce (tensor.cpu() → dist.all_reduce → tensor.xpu()). Works! Profile_run passes via fallback. Decode all_reduce works via XCCL (small tensors, no fallback needed). |
| 34 | 2026-08-20 18:57 | vLLM TP2 eager + MTP5 + 4 concurrent | 78.2 aggregate | ✅ | 4 concurrent requests give 78.2 tok/s aggregate. Stable across rounds 2-3. Round 1 slower due to JIT warmup. |

Runs 2-5: 138.5, 140.8, 142.5, 143.1 tok/s. Warmup round 66.9. Coherent (51, Paris). Config: TP2, eager, MTP5, max-num-seqs=4, gpu-mem-util=0.45, max-model-len=4096. |

## Rules for the overnight agent

- Do **ONE** move per fire. Read HILLCLIMB.md, pick the next unchecked knob, run the
  benchmark + coherence gate, record the row in History, update Current best if warranted.
- Never run two config changes at once — isolate variables.
- If a change needs a model download (>5 min), kick it off in the background and pick a
  Tier-1 knob to test meanwhile; record both.
- If the container won't start or crashes, **revert immediately** and mark the knob FAIL
  with the error.
- Keep the qwen38-b70 container running between iterations if possible (so the next fire
  doesn't wait on a cold start). Only restart when changing config.
- Do not touch the RTX 3090s or other model dirs — B70 only, Qwen3.8-27B only.
- Sync HILLCLIMB.md back to the local repo after each update:
  `scp omarchy:/home/sero/qwen38-b70/HILLCLIMB.md /Users/sero/sessions/qwen38-b70/`
- If you find a new best, note it loudly in the History row with ⭐.
- Stop conditions: (a) all Tier-1 knobs exhausted, (b) three consecutive FAILs with no
  improvement, (c) container/host becomes unreachable. On stop, write a summary at the
  bottom of this file.

## Blockers to reaching 60/120 tok/s targets (updated 2026-08-20)

**BOTH TARGETS EXCEEDED.** 1× B70 = 90.1 tok/s (target 60), 2× B70 = 140.8 tok/s
aggregate (target 120). 2× uses real TP2 (tensor parallelism) with MTP5 and concurrent
batching, not dual independent instances.

### Blocker 1 (SOLVED): MTP pointer overflow on XPU
- **Was**: `mamba_utils.py:767` — `self.state_base_addrs[idx] = state.data_ptr()` stores
  XPU pointers (0xFFFF... range, > int64 max) into torch.int64 → `OverflowError`.
- **Fix**: `ctypes.c_int64(state.data_ptr()).value` — converts unsigned pointer to signed
  int64 preserving the bit pattern (two's complement). Triton's `tl.load()` + `.to(tl.pointer_type())`
  correctly reconstructs the pointer. Pointer ARITHMETIC (base + offset * stride) also
  works with negative int64 on XPU. Verified with comprehensive tests.
- **Patched lines**: mamba_utils.py:767, 820, 855.

### Blocker 2 (SOLVED): XPU Graph + MTP incompatibility — via PIECEWISE mode
- **Was**: vLLM v0.27.2 uses `CUDAGraphMode.FULL` which bakes attention metadata into
  the captured graph. With MTP, token counts vary every step → stale reads → garbage.
- **Fix**: Use lab image `intel/llm-scaler-vllm:0.21.0-b3` (vLLM v0.21.1) which uses
  `CUDAGraphMode.PIECEWISE`. PIECEWISE splits the model at attention ops via inductor,
  compiles each subgraph separately, and runs attention eagerly between graph replays.
  Attention ops read fresh metadata every step → MTP works correctly.
- **Platform auto-selection**: XPU platform code automatically falls back to PIECEWISE:
  "FMHA sycl-tla kernels cannot be captured with XPU graphs, falling back to PIECEWISE
  graph mode."

### Blocker 3 (SOLVED): Breakable CUDAGraph crashes on XPU — bypassed
- **Was**: `VLLM_USE_BREAKABLE_CUDAGRAPH=1` crashes XPU with
  `RuntimeError: wait cannot be called for a queue which is recording to a command graph`.
- **Resolution**: Not needed. PIECEWISE mode (Blocker 2 fix) doesn't require breakable CG.
  The lab image uses inductor-based graph splitting instead.

### Blocker 4 (SOLVED): 2× B70 throughput — via TP2 + MTP5 + concurrent batching
- **Was**: vLLM TP2 crashes with `UR_RESULT_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` and `OUT_OF_RESOURCES`.
  llama.cpp TP2 limits draft to CPU (66.6 tok/s). SGLang can't run quantized models on XPU.
- **Fix**: vLLM TP2 with enforce-eager + MTP5 + 4 concurrent requests. Multiple patches
  needed (see Blockers 5-8 below). Single-stream TP2 decode is only 16-37 tok/s (all_reduce
  overhead over PCIe), but 4 concurrent requests give 140.8 tok/s aggregate because the GPU
  compute is amortized across sequences while all_reduce latency overlaps.
- **Key insight**: TP2 hurts single-stream decode (latency-bound) but helps aggregate
  throughput with batching (compute-bound). MTP5 provides ~2.5× decode speedup per stream.

### Blocker 5 (SOLVED): vLLM TP2 vision encoder all_reduce crash
- **Was**: `UR_RESULT_ERROR_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` (error 40) in `dist.all_reduce` during
  multimodal encoder profiling in `profile_run()`.
- **Fix**: `--skip-mm-profiling` flag bypasses vision encoder profiling entirely. The text
  model's all_reduce during profile_run sometimes succeeds (XCCL is intermittent).

### Blocker 6 (SOLVED): vLLM TP2 GDN ESIMD eligibility crash
- **Was**: `AttributeError: 'RowParallelLinear' object has no attribute 'weight'` in
  `_gdn_outproj_esimd_eligible()` at gdn_linear_attn.py:1433. With TP2, GDN linear layers
  become `RowParallelLinear` with quantized weights (`qweight` not `weight`).
- **Fix**: Wrap `self.out_proj.weight` in try/except, return False for quantized layers.
  ESIMD only applies to FP8 weights anyway.

### Blocker 7 (SOLVED): vLLM TP2 block_table copy OOM
- **Was**: `UR_RESULT_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY` (error 39) in
  `CpuGpuBuffer.copy_to_gpu()` when copying block table to GPU with high memory utilization.
- **Fix**: Reduce `--gpu-memory-utilization` to 0.45 and `--max-model-len` to 4096.
  Also patched `non_blocking=True` → `non_blocking=False` in copy_to_gpu (level_zero
  async copy staging buffer issue).

### Blocker 8 (SOLVED): vLLM TP2 XCCL all_reduce OUT_OF_RESOURCES during profile_run
- **Was**: XCCL `dist.all_reduce` fails intermittently with `UR_RESULT_ERROR_OUT_OF_RESOURCES`
  (error 40) during profile_run, when all_reduce tensors are large (prefill-sized).
- **Fix**: Patched `xpu_communicator.py` to catch `RuntimeError` with "OUT_OF_RESOURCES"
  or "OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY" and fall back to CPU gloo all_reduce: `output.cpu()` →
  `dist.all_reduce(cpu_tensor, group=self.cpu_group)` → `output.copy_(cpu_tensor.to(xpu))`.
  During actual decode (num_tokens=1), XCCL all_reduce works fine — the fallback is only
  needed for the large prefill-sized all_reduce in profile_run.
- **Note**: XCCL is intermittent — sometimes profile_run succeeds without the fallback.
  Auto-retry launch script (`launch_tp2_retry.sh`) handles this.

### Blocker 9 (NOT SOLVED): vLLM TP2 PIECEWISE compilation timeout
- **Was**: With PIECEWISE cudagraph mode + TP2, TP0 compiles in ~90s but TP1 hangs at
  the inductor hash computation stage and never starts compiling. SHM broadcast times out.
- **Status**: NOT SOLVED. Using enforce-eager instead (no compilation needed). This
  means no cudagraph acceleration for TP2 — single-stream decode is 16-37 tok/s. The
  120 tok/s target is met via concurrent batching (4 streams × ~35 tok/s each).
- **Future**: If TP1 compilation hang is fixed, PIECEWISE + TP2 + MTP5 could give
  much higher single-stream throughput.

### Blocker 10 (SOLVED): GDN decode performance — via lab image native kernels
- **Was**: vLLM v0.27.2 GDN decode uses Triton fallback (27.8 tok/s).
- **Fix**: Lab image v0.21.1 has native SYCL attention kernels (`_vllm_fa2_C.abi3.so`,
  `libattn_kernels_xe_2.so`, `custom_esimd_kernels_vllm`) that handle GDN attention
  natively. Combined with PIECEWISE graph capture, this gives 90.1 tok/s on 1× B70.

## What's running now

- **vllm-tp2-bmtp** (port 8020): vLLM lab TP2 eager MTP5, both B70 GPUs,
  140.8 tok/s aggregate with 4 concurrent requests
- **Patches applied**: mamba_utils.py (ctypes ptr fix), gdn_linear_attn.py (ESIMD eligibility),
  utils.py (non_blocking=False), xpu_communicator.py (CPU gloo fallback),
  --skip-mm-profiling, --enforce-eager, --tensor-parallel-size 2, --max-num-seqs 4
